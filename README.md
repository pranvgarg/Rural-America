# üåü **Predicting Household Income in Rural and Small-Town America** üåü

Welcome to our Data Science Final Project! This project aims to predict the median household income across various counties in the United States using five years of historical data. We utilized the **Atlas of Rural and Small-Town America** dataset from the USDA, which includes comprehensive information on jobs, income, people, and veterans.

## üìú **Project Overview**

### **Main Question**
> How do 5 years of historical data (2017-2021) on various U.S. census features affect future median household income values?

### **Why is this Important?**
Understanding the factors that influence household income in rural areas can inform better policy-making and resource allocation, helping to uplift communities that often face unique economic challenges. Our analysis offers valuable insights for policymakers, non-profits, and community organizations.

## üîç **Data Insights and Analysis**

### **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- **Initial Features**: 250 features across four datasets (jobs, income, people, veterans).
- **Post-Cleaning**: 98 features were retained after removing irrelevant and null data points.

### **Feature Engineering**
- Calculated ratios for better comparison across counties.
- Normalized variables to standardize data.
- Example Features:
  - **Ed1LessThanHS_perCapita**: Per capita individuals with less than a high school diploma.
  - **FemaleHHRatio**: Ratio of female-headed households to total households.

### **Modeling**
We implemented several models to predict median household income:
- **Random Forest**
- **XGBoost**
- **Ridge Regression**
- **Lasso Regression**
- **K-means Clustering**

#### **Best Performing Model: XGBoost**
- **RMSE**: 5056
- **Important Features**:
  - **PercentPoverty0to17**
  - **HomeOwnership_Education**
  - **Ed5CollegePlus_perCapita**

## üìä **Results**

- **Key Predictors**: 
  - **Education**: Higher education levels are strongly correlated with higher median household income.
  - **Poverty**: Counties with higher percentages of children living in poverty tend to have lower median incomes.

- **Final Thoughts**: Focusing on reducing poverty, particularly child poverty, and increasing access to higher education could significantly impact median household income across rural America.
